ABCDEF Keyboard Layout for pranks - The keyboard instead of being "qwerty" will be "abcdef"

# How does it work
Basically, your keyboard has a layout. Yours may be QWERTY, and it goes qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm.  
Well with this, you can prank your friends, by installing this, by downloading from the releases tab and running setup.exe  
Now your keyboard will go in alphabetical order (abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz)
Have fun!
